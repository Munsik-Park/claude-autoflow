## Summary

<!-- 1-3 sentences describing the change. -->

## Changes

<!-- Bullet list of key changes. -->

## Design / ADR

<!-- Name the documents this PR used as decision basis, reachable from this PR.
     Reviewers use only what is linked here plus context they discover while tracing
     the changed surface. Do NOT link .autoflow/* (gitignored, unreachable from the PR). -->

- Design note: <path > section, or N/A>
- ADR: <path, or "ADR not required: <one-line reason>">
- Architecture context: <path > section, or N/A>

Check exactly one:

- [ ] No architecture impact.
- [ ] Architecture impact — ADR linked above.
- [ ] Design impact, ADR not required — design note linked above + reason stated.
- [ ] N/A - docs, tests, or operational maintenance only.

## Acceptance criteria

<!-- The reviewer must be able to reach the AC from this PR. Prevents repeated false
     `High` findings from reviewing against an assumed contract. -->

- AC: linked issue #N > Acceptance Criteria  (or stated inline in the PR body)

## Issue link

<!-- HOST-CLOSE-LINE -->

<!--
Host PR (HANDOFF): the orchestrator replaces the line above with the literal
close-keyword reference (e.g., the GitHub-recognised `Closes` pattern + issue
number) so external merge closes the issue.

Sub-repo PR: use `Part of {{GITHUB_ORG}}/{{REPO_ORCHESTRATOR}}#N` (no close keyword —
sub-repo PRs merge first; closing the issue prematurely is a documented
sequencing failure).

Rules / infra PR: write `N/A` if there is no tracking issue.

Reference: docs/git-workflow.md > Issue Auto-Close,
CLAUDE.md > PR Issue Auto-Close.

## Sub-repo merge dependency

<!--
This block enforces the merge-sequencing contract from
docs/external-review-sequencing.md. For host PRs created at HANDOFF that
include sub-repo changes, the `blocked-by-subrepo` label is applied
automatically by scripts/handoff/create-host-pr.sh and removed by
the handoff-sequence.yml workflow on sub-repo PR merge.
-->

- [ ] This PR is **draft** until the sub-repo dependency is merged (host PRs at HANDOFF are created with `--draft`).
- [ ] Sub-repo PR (if any): _link the upstream PR here_ (e.g., `{{UPSTREAM_SUBREPO}}#NNNN`).
- [ ] Sub-repo PR has been merged into its upstream default branch.
- [ ] Submodule pointer in this branch (`services/{{REPO_SUBMODULE}}`) matches the sub-repo merge commit. **External reviewer**: see `docs/external-review-sequencing.md` for the pointer-bump procedure.
- [ ] The `blocked-by-subrepo` label has been removed from this PR (auto-removed by `handoff-sequence.yml` when the sub-repo PR merges; if still present, the merge order has not yet been satisfied).
- [ ] This PR has been promoted from draft to **ready for review**.

If this PR is **host-only** (no sub-repo change in the dev branch), mark every box above as N/A in the box label (e.g., `- [x] N/A — host-only PR`) and the orchestrator removes the `blocked-by-subrepo` label at PR creation (the helper script omits the label when `--no-subrepo-dep` is passed).

## AutoFlow

- Issue: <!-- #N or N/A -->
- Phase: `awaiting-external-review`
- Evaluation summary: _link to `.autoflow/issue-N.json` or paste GATE:QUALITY summary line_

## Testing

- [ ] Unit / integration tests pass on CI
- [ ] Manual checklist items (if any) noted in PR description body

## Reviewer

Merging is performed **only by the external reviewer**, never by AutoFlow. See `docs/external-review-sequencing.md` for the merge sequence.
