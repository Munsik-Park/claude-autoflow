# Auto-Flow Design Rationale

This document explains the design intent and reasoning behind every major decision in Auto-Flow.
Where CLAUDE.md describes **what to do and how**, this document explains **why** it was designed that way.

**Any new AI reading this repository should read this document first.**
Understanding the design intent takes priority over following the rules.
Without understanding the reasons, an AI may propose something that "looks better" but undermines a core principle.

## The Problems This System Solves

Auto-Flow addresses structural problems that arise in AI-driven development environments.

### Problem 1: AI Is Biased Toward Solving the Moment It Receives an Issue

AI is trained to be helpful. The moment it receives an issue, the frame "this is a problem to solve" locks into its context. Even when analyzing code afterward, it tends to overlook parts where the existing structure already handles the concern, or proposes unnecessary code changes.

This is not a defect in AI. It is a byproduct of "be helpful" training. It cannot be fixed through training alone. **It must be blocked structurally.**

### Problem 2: A Single Session Cannot Effectively Challenge Its Own Reasoning

When analysis and evaluation happen in the same conversation, previously generated text influences subsequent generation (self-reinforcement). Evaluation converges toward "my analysis was correct." This is a structural problem inherent to the context window.

### Problem 3: AI Self-Reporting Is Unreliable

Even when an AI declares "PASS," whether that judgment actually meets the defined criteria is a separate question. AI tends to implicitly adjust standards while scoring, or interpret edge cases favorably.

## Core Design Decisions and Their Reasoning

### Decision 1: AI-A Does Not Receive the Issue Content (3-Phase Independent Analysis)

**What it does**

- **AI-A**: Analyzes code structure only — without seeing the issue content
- **AI-B**: Analyzes the issue text only — without seeing the code
- **Phase 3**: AI-A evaluates AI-B's proposed resolution from a structural perspective

**Why it works this way**

Information isolation is the key. If AI-A knows the issue, it starts looking for "structure that solves this problem." Without the issue, it sees the structure as it actually is. The information asymmetry between the two AIs creates the validity of cross-verification.

It is normal for AI-B to use zero tools. Its purpose is to analyze the problem from the issue text alone. If it reads code, it shares the same bias as AI-A, making Phase 3 verification purely ceremonial.

Claude is already trained to "give balanced answers." It rarely produces overtly one-sided responses. That is the effect of training. But the bias Auto-Flow prevents is different. When Claude receives an issue, "I need to solve this" is already embedded in the context. When it analyzes code in that state, it reads existing structure that already handles the concern as "insufficient." There is no malice. It is correct, helpful behavior. That is precisely why training cannot catch it. Training blocks "bad answers." Structure blocks "good intentions aimed in the wrong direction." This is why information isolation is necessary.

**Why this design must not be changed**

The suggestion "let's give AI-A the issue for efficiency" destroys the core of this system. Bias prevention can only be achieved through information isolation. Claude's built-in bias mitigation training is effective at balancing response tone, but it cannot prevent context contamination.

### Decision 2: Evaluation AI Is Spawned Fresh Every Time

**What it does**

The Evaluation AI at GATE:HYPOTHESIS, GATE:PLAN, SHIP, and GATE:QUALITY is created new for each invocation. It carries no prior conversation history.

**Why it works this way**

To start from a state with no trace of prior reasoning. When the same agent creates a plan and then evaluates it, it struggles to reject its own plan. A freshly spawned agent sees only the deliverable. It has no investment in the process.

**Bias elimination takes priority over cost**

"Reusing the same agent saves tokens" is factually true. But in this system, bias elimination takes priority over cost optimization. The quality of an expert system comes from the independence of its judgments.

---

### Decision 3: The Hook Does Not Trust AI's PASS Judgment

**What it does**

`check-autoflow-gate.sh` does **not** read the `pass` field written by the AI. It calculates the average, minimum, and security score directly from the raw `scores` object.

**Why it works this way**

To bring the trust chain down to the script level. An AI can implicitly decide "this is good enough to pass" while recording scores. The script ignores that judgment and looks only at the numbers. Numbers cannot be manipulated (within the system's constraints).

**What this means**

No matter how eloquently an AI says "the plan is excellent," if the scores don't meet the threshold, it cannot advance to the next phase. The gate operates on numbers, not explanations.

---

### Decision 4: The Pipeline Is Designed to Be Stateless

**What it does**

Each issue is processed independently. Past issue evaluation results do not influence the current issue's analysis.

**Why it works this way**

If a past evaluation was wrong and it influences the next evaluation, bias propagates. As incorrect judgments accumulate, the system hardens in a particular direction. Injecting past data into a pipeline whose principle is bias elimination undermines that principle.

**Improvement loops happen outside the pipeline**

Analysis of pass/fail patterns, modification of evaluation criteria, and identification of cross-issue correlations are performed by humans externally. Changes are reflected through CLAUDE.md and evaluation prompt modifications, with history tracked in Git. If the pipeline modifies its own criteria, it becomes impossible to trace which point in time had the correct judgment.

**However, factual lookups are different**

Injecting past evaluation results (bias injection) and looking up past code change history or issue context (factual lookup) are different things. Querying related issues and commit history at DIAGNOSE is allowed because it serves to accurately understand the current state.

---

### Decision 5: Phase Transitions Are Completion-Condition Based

**What it does**

Each phase transitions to the next only when its stated completion conditions are met. All phases are performed regardless of change size.

**Why it works this way**

AI tends to judge "this change is small enough to skip phases." That judgment itself is a product of bias. The thought "this one is simple" causes verification to be skipped, and problems emerge from the skipped verification. Simplicity can be determined after the process, not before it.

The act of judging "this change is simple" is itself a product of bias. That judgment is made before implementation. Before implementation, there is no way to know whether it is actually simple. The judgment may sometimes be correct, but when it is wrong, problems emerge from the verification that was skipped. Auto-Flow does not permit this judgment at all. Simplicity can be evaluated post-hoc, after all phases are completed. Pre-process judgment is not allowed.

---

### Decision 6: Structure Evaluation FAIL Means Issue Close

**What it does**

When the structure evaluation at PREFLIGHT–DIAGNOSE returns FAIL, Auto-Flow terminates and the issue is closed. It means the existing structure can already handle the concern — no code change needed.

**Why it works this way**

The best code is code that is never written. AI feels pressure to create something when it receives an issue. Structure evaluation is the first gate that blocks that pressure. In practice, this judgment has prevented unnecessary code changes — when existing architecture already solved the problem.

---

### Decision 7: All Loops Must Have Termination Conditions

**What it does**

Every repetition in Auto-Flow (e.g., GREEN↔VERIFY test-fix cycles, REVISION→GATE:QUALITY re-evaluation cycles, LAND revision requests) has an explicit maximum retry count. No loop can run indefinitely.

**Why it works this way**

When a loop fails, the work does not simply stop. The failure cause is classified, and the flow regresses to the appropriate phase. When all retries are exhausted, the work is handed to a human. There is no scenario where a loop never terminates.

For comparison: review gate structures where two models find problems in each other's output (e.g., Codex-style mutual review) lack explicit termination conditions, creating infinite loop risk. Auto-Flow blocks this through three mechanisms: **maximum regression count + cause classification + defined human escalation point.**

**This principle applies to all future additions**

When introducing any new loop structure to this system, it must have an explicit termination condition. A loop without a termination condition is not permitted. This is not a guideline — it is a hard constraint.

## Evaluation System Design Intent

### Why Scoring Criteria Are Not Fixed

The evaluation categories and weights in CLAUDE.md must be customized per project. They should reflect "what actually matters in this project," not universal standards. As a project matures, patterns emerge showing which items correlate with actual failures. At that point, humans adjust the criteria.

### Why PASS Criteria Are Strict (Average >= 7.5, Individual >= 7)

Lenient criteria create a pattern of "scoring high on easy items to raise the average while passing difficult items." This is why individual minimum thresholds exist. The reason security score <= 3 triggers mandatory rework is the same — some items cannot be diluted by averaging.

### The Role of Issue Analysis Evaluation (GATE:HYPOTHESIS)

The purpose is to ensure only well-analyzed issues proceed to implementation. Entering implementation with insufficient analysis incurs greater costs later. The stricter this gate, the higher the quality of subsequent phases.

## What Must NOT Be Done in This System

The following may look like "better approaches" but undermine core principles:

| Do Not | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| Give AI-A the issue content | Context contamination → bias introduced |
| Reuse the Evaluation AI | Self-reinforcement bias → independence lost |
| Trust the Hook's `pass` field | Trusting AI self-report → gate neutralized |
| Inject past evaluation results into current analysis | Bias propagation → system hardens in one direction |
| Allow phase-skipping judgment | "This one is simple" is itself a biased judgment |
| Let the pipeline modify its own criteria | Judgment tracing impossible → trust chain collapse |
| Design loops without termination conditions | No maximum retry → infinite loop risk → system hangs |

---

## Known Limitations and Ongoing Discussions

### Limitations

- **No failure learning loop**: Currently accumulated manually via issue comments. Pass/fail pattern analysis is performed by humans externally.
- **No cross-issue correlation detection**: Cannot automatically detect repeated similar-pattern issues. Under internal discussion.
- **No lightweight mode**: Full phase execution even for small changes. Overhead exists.

### Under Discussion

- Including related issue and commit history lookup at DIAGNOSE entry (factual lookup, not bias injection)
- Systematizing issue preparation stages through external cross-issue correlation analysis

## Summary: The Design Philosophy of This System

**The pipeline's goal is not to get better with each run, but to perform well without bias every single time.**

Improvement does not happen automatically inside the pipeline. Humans observe patterns, make judgments, modify CLAUDE.md, and those changes take effect from the next issue onward. The pipeline is a tool that executes those criteria without bias.

When adding new features or modifications to this system, ask this question first:

> "Does this change eliminate a bias, or does it introduce one?"
